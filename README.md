## 🧠 About Me

Cloud computing is more than just technology—it's how I turn ideas into real, impactful solutions.  
For me, it's a space where learning, building, and innovation come together.

**Work in Progress, Driven by Passion**  
As a final‑year Computer Science student, I cut my teeth building dynamic websites with React front‑ends and lightweight backends—delivering tailored solutions for individual clients and small businesses.  
Through self‑driven projects, I discovered how cloud computing can scale, secure, and elevate everything I build.

**Security‑Driven Exploration**  
I didn't just want to build apps—I wanted to **secure them**.  
By applying threat modelling, IAM best practices, encryption, and automated checks, I embraced the full potential of AWS.

**Always Improving**  
Holding certifications like **AWS SAA**, **Security Specialty**, **SysOps**, and **CompTIA Security+**, I’ve built strong foundations—then solidified them through real projects and hands-on labs.
