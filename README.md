## ☁️ About Me

Cloud computing is more than just technology—it's how I turn ideas into real, impactful solutions. For me, it's a space where learning, building, and innovation come together.

🎓 With a Computer Science foundation, I started by building dynamic websites with React and lightweight backends. But through self‑driven AWS projects, I discovered how the cloud can scale and secure everything I create.

🔐 My passion for cybersecurity led me to explore IAM, threat modeling, encryption, and secure hosting. I now build end-to-end cloud solutions that are not only functional, but resilient and secure.

📚 With 4 certifications (AWS SAA, SysOps, Security Specialty, and CompTIA Security+), I’ve laid a strong foundation—strengthened every day by practical experience and real-world deployments.
